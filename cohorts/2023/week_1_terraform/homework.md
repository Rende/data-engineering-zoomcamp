## Week 1 Homework

In this homework we'll prepare the environment by creating resources in GCP with Terraform.

In your VM on GCP install Terraform. Copy the files from the course repo
[here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp/tree/main/week_1_basics_n_setup/1_terraform_gcp/terraform) to your VM.

Modify the files as necessary to create a GCP Bucket and Big Query Dataset.


## Question 1. Creating Resources

After updating the main.tf and variable.tf files run:

```
terraform apply
```

Paste the output of this command into the homework submission form.

NOTE THAT I RUN THIS COMMAND ON MY MACHINE, NOT VM ON GCP TO AVOID COSTS

THE OUTPUT:

```

var.project
  Your GCP Project ID

  Enter a value: de-zoomcamp-2023-XXXXX


Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are
indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # google_bigquery_dataset.dataset will be created

Note: You didn't use the -out option to save this plan, so Terraform can't guarantee to take exactly
these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.

Do you really want to destroy all resources?
  Terraform will destroy all your managed infrastructure, as shown above.
  There is no undo. Only 'yes' will be accepted to confirm.

  Enter a value: no

Destroy cancelled.
